## Goal of this Code

The Goal of this projekt is, to create a user-friendly passwort manager with the language powershell.
The GUI will be simple and easy to handle.
The entered passwords will be encrypted and saved on a sqplite database that we will create.

S - Specific (Spezifisch):
The goal is to develop a PowerShell script for a password manager that utilizes SQLite for data storage. The script should include functionalities such as password encryption, adding, editing, and deleting passwords. Additional information, including username, email, notes, and tags, should be stored alongside the password (fields: Title, Username, Password, Urls, Tags, Notes). The script should create a graphical user interface (GUI) and potentially incorporate an icon. Upon the initial launch, if no password is set, the user should be prompted to set one.

M - Measurable (Messbar):
The success of the script will be measured by its ability to effectively manage passwords, with features like encryption, addition, editing, and deletion. The inclusion of supplementary information and the creation of a user-friendly GUI with a potential icon will also be measurable criteria. The prompt for setting a password on the first launch adds a measurable criterion for user security.

A - Achievable (Erreichbar):
The goal is achievable given the specified functionalities and the tools (PowerShell and SQLite) selected for implementation. The encryption, database management, and GUI development are within the capabilities of PowerShell scripting. The inclusion of user prompts for password setting enhances the achievable aspect by ensuring a user-friendly experience.

R - Relevant (Relevant):
The goal is relevant in the context of secure password management, as it addresses encryption, user interface, and the storage of additional information. The script aims to provide a comprehensive solution for effective password management, aligning with the importance of safeguarding sensitive information.

T - Time-bound (Zeitgebunden):
The goal should be completed within a specified time frame, aiming for a reasonable development period. A milestone could be set to complete the script and conduct testing within a specific timeframe, ensuring timely delivery and implementation. This helps maintain focus and prioritize tasks within a defined schedule.
